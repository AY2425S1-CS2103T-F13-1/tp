* This is **TAHub**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `TAHub` because it acts as a hub for TAs to manage their students.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[TAHub Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-f13-1.github.io/tp/)**.
